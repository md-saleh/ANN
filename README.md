# ANN
Some implementations for artificial neural networks

It contains implementations for:
- [X] Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)
- [ ] Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks
- [ ] Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOMs)
- [ ] Neural Gas
- [ ] Hopfield Nets
- [ ] Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- [ ] Recurrent MLPs
- [ ] Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- [ ] Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Currently I'll be re-implementing the networks in Python instead of MATLAB and then I'll start adding the rest of them to the repo.
